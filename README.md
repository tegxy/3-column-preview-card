# CHALLENGE-iii
**My 3rd git repo**
This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

**The Challenge:** 
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

**Process**

Built with

- VScode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid

**What I learned**
Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly.
Some of the CSS properties were:
- how to use my floats properly (always remember to clear floats)
<style>
  .clear-float {
                  clear: both;}
  </style>
  <body>
  ......
 <div class="clear-float"></div>
  </body>
 
- how and when to using positioning
- how to use html semantics
- more knowledge on divs, their height and width
- how to also use psuedo-classes and hover states

#sedan-button {
    color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
  }
#sedan-button:hover {
    background-color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
    color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
    border: 2px white solid;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
